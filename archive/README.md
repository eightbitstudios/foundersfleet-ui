# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files from the FoundersFleet development process.

## Structure

### `/python-scripts/`
Contains all Python scripts used for automated fixes and updates during development. These scripts modified HTML, CSS, and structure across multiple files. See the README in that directory for details about each script.

### `/backup-files/`
Contains backup copies of files made before major changes:
- `founders.html.backup` - Backup of the founders page before restructuring

### `/old-versions/`
Empty directory reserved for storing old versions of files if needed in the future.

### `/versions/`
Contains historical versions of the application from earlier development stages:
- Multiple versions of `app.html` and `index.html` from different dates
- Subdirectories with complete snapshots of the application at specific points
- Version notes and documentation for each snapshot

## Purpose
This archive serves as:
1. Historical reference for development decisions
2. Backup of automated scripts for potential reuse
3. Recovery point if rollback is needed
4. Documentation of the development process

## Note
Files in this directory are not part of the active application and should not be deployed. They are kept for reference and documentation purposes only.
