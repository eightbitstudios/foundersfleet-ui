# Product Tracker System - FoundersFleet

## Overview

The FoundersFleet Product Tracker System is a comprehensive project management and development tracking solution that aligns user stories with implementation progress. This system provides complete visibility into feature development, from initial concept through production deployment.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`/product/product-map.json`** - Single source of truth for all stories and their current status
2. **`/product/docs/index.html`** - Interactive visual UI for browsing, filtering, and managing stories
3. **`product-tracker-concept.md`** - Documentation and system overview (this file)

### Integration Points

- **Developer Tools**: Embedded access through the main application's developer tools panel
- **Main Application**: Direct navigation links between tracker and app prototypes
- **Version Control**: Integrated with project versioning and backup systems

## Workflow Management

### Status Progression

The system implements a standardized workflow with the following statuses:

```
backlog → markup → integrate → execute → stage → production
```

#### Status Definitions

- **`backlog`**: Initial concepts and planned features awaiting development
- **`markup`**: Features being designed and prototyped
- **`integrate`**: Features being integrated into the main codebase
- **`execute`**: Features in active development and testing
- **`stage`**: Features deployed to staging environment for final testing
- **`production`**: Features live in production environment

### Priority Levels

- **`high`**: Critical features required for core functionality
- **`medium`**: Important features that enhance user experience
- **`low`**: Nice-to-have features for future consideration

## Feature Metadata Structure

Each feature in the product-map.json includes comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "FF-FTR-XXX": {
    "title": "Feature Title",
    "status": "integrate",
    "epic": "epic-name",
    "priority": "high",
    "files": ["app.html", "other-files.js"],
    "description": "Detailed feature description",
    "history": [
      {
        "date": "Month Day, Year",
        "change": "Description of change made"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Fields

- **`id`**: Unique identifier following pattern `FF-FTR-###`
- **`title`**: Human-readable feature name
- **`status`**: Current workflow stage
- **`epic`**: Feature grouping (e.g., "core-app", "authentication", "community")
- **`priority`**: Development priority level
- **`files`**: Array of related files in the codebase
- **`description`**: Detailed explanation of the feature
- **`history`**: Chronological record of changes and progress

## Visual Interface Features

### Dashboard Views

1. **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop interface for status management
2. **List View**: Detailed tabular view with filtering and search
3. **History View**: Development timeline and session tracking

### Interactive Features

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Move stories between workflow stages
- **Real-time Search**: Filter stories by title, ID, or epic
- **Status Filtering**: View stories by current workflow stage
- **Feature History**: Detailed change tracking for each story
- **Navigation Integration**: Direct links to prototype implementations

### Visual Indicators

- **Color Coding**: Status-based color system for quick recognition
- **Progress Metrics**: Live counts and statistics
- **Priority Indicators**: Visual priority level identification

## Development History Tracking

### History Entry Format

```javascript
{
  date: "Month Day, Year",
  title: "Session Summary",
  description: "Detail of development session",
  changes: [
    "List of key changes made",
    "Another change description"
  ]
}
```

### Session Tracking

The system maintains detailed records of:

- **Development Sessions**: Major coding sessions with Claude
- **Feature Changes**: Individual story updates and modifications
- **Status Transitions**: Workflow stage changes with timestamps
- **Implementation Details**: Technical changes and code modifications

## Current Implementation Status

### Active Stories: 27 Features

- **Production**: 1 feature (Initial Project Setup)
- **Integrate**: 19 features (Core app functionality)
- **Backlog**: 7 features (Future enhancements)

### Epic Categories

- **infrastructure**: Project setup and foundations
- **core-app**: Main application functionality
- **authentication**: User management and security
- **community**: Social features and networking
- **flightplan**: Founder journey tracking
- **missions**: Task and goal management
- **development**: Developer tools and deployment
- **vault**: Document and file management
- **ui-ux**: User interface and experience
